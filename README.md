# ðŸ©º CataGuide-Net: AI-Guided System for Cataract Surgery (https://aris-ai-lab.github.io/CataGuide-Net/)
CataGuide-Net is an AI-assisted surgical guidance framework designed to enhance cataract surgery through real-time perception and decision support. It integrates:

ðŸŽ¯ Instrument Segmentation â€“ accurately identifies surgical tools and anatomical structures

ðŸ›  Tip Detection â€“ pinpoints tool tips to monitor critical movements

ðŸ”„ Stage Recognition â€“ classifies surgical phases using temporal video models

ðŸ¤– Trajectory Guidance â€“ provides skill-based feedback and expert trajectory imitation

The system supports intelligent training, surgical evaluation, and potential intraoperative assistance, especially for resource-limited settings.
### Cataract Instrument Segmentation and Tool tip detection

```bash
cd cataract_Seg
```

### Cataract Surgery Stage Recognition
```bash
cd Video_Classification
```

## Getting Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the Trajectory Generator
```bash
python GAIL_train.py
```
